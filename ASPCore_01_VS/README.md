# ASPCore_01 with Visual Studio, SQL, Entity Framework and MVC

This is an attempt to rebuild quickly the basic ASP Core website which is using MVC in Visual Studio

It's a bit of a mish-mash but at least it is working.

What I did was firstly followed the book and got the _ViewStart and _Layout pages working and also the index.cshtml page with index.cshtml.cs code-behind page working also.

I then put in the Northwind files and it seems to work fine.

Although I wasn't following the book for the Northwind files so the end result is a bit of a mish-mash!!!

Update 2/1/2019

I have removed all unnecessary packages from the using; statements at the top of the code.

Also the Nuget packages which are required are as follows :

Microsoft.AspNetCore.All

Microsoft.NETCore.App

Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design
