# Entity_10_Core_01

This program attempts to put, in one single file, 
a simple Northwind database read of Products with their Categories.

It is built in Visual Studio

It uses SQL 

To reduce complexity I have put everything in one simple Program.cs file.

Everything works as long as you have Northwind database connected to 
Visual Studio.

Happy coding!
